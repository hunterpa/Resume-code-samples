Some test cases for the cave exploration program

news=completely rolled up

enws=not rolled up

ssneewwn=rolled up

snwenswneswnesws=not rolled up

snwesnwenswnsenswesnwesn=rolled up

n wes=incorrect input

nawesnwsnewnesnwensnwenswnesnwnesnwn=incorrect input

the stack checks to see if a person is back at the entrance of a cave after exploring it.  news works and enws does not because while the person has moved in a circle, they may be at a higher or lower elevation than from where they started if it was not a perfect backtrack.  The program tests whether there is a guarantee that a rope is completely rolled up after exploring a cave.
